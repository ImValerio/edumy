# Edumy


Our project aims to create a clone of the Udemy site, a well-known ecommerce for the sale of online courses.

Specifically, we have set ourselves the following objectives:
- Feedback system (reviews of the course, questions to the video, notification to the user when the author of the course has answered his question)
- Ability to search for courses within the site
- Recommendation system
- Shopping cart management
- Upload videos in multimedia format (specify formats) based on a specific course
- Ability to create a course (only users who are registered as authors)
